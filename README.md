# Labelai

Labelai is an online tool designed to label images, useful for training AI models.

It's totally client-side, there is no request to any server. It is implemented with Next.js + Preact.

Annotations are saved as XML files in **PASCAL VOC** format, the format used by ImageNet. Besides, it also supports **YOLO** format.

It's strongly inspired by [**labelImg**](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).
